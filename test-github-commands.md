# GitHub Commands Test

## Issue Analysis

The GitHub commands (`ai-ide-bas.github.configure`, `ai-ide-bas.github.analyze`, `ai-ide-bas.github.insights`) are not being found in VSCode.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Commands are properly defined in package.json** ✅

    - All three commands are listed in the `contributes.commands` section
    - Commands have proper titles and categories

2. **Commands are properly registered in extension.ts** ✅

    - `registerGitHubCommands(context)` is called on line 201
    - The function is properly imported from `./activate`

3. **Commands are properly implemented in registerCommands.ts** ✅

    - All three commands are implemented with proper error handling
    - Commands use `vscode.commands.registerCommand()` correctly

4. **TypeScript compilation issues were fixed** ✅
    - Fixed type errors in the command implementations
    - All type checks pass

## Potential Issues

1. **Extension not reloaded**: The extension might need to be reloaded to pick up the new commands
2. **Build issues**: The extension might not be properly built with the latest changes
3. **VSCode cache**: VSCode might be using a cached version of the extension

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Reload VSCode Window

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Run "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Test the commands again

### Solution 2: Rebuild Extension

1. Stop VSCode
2. Delete the dist directory
3. Rebuild the extension
4. Restart VSCode

### Solution 3: Test Commands Manually

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "GitHub" to see if the commands appear
3. Try running the commands directly

## Verification Steps

1. Check if commands appear in Command Palette
2. Test each command individually
3. Check VSCode Developer Console for errors
4. Verify extension is properly loaded

## Expected Behavior

After reloading, the following commands should be available:

- `ai-ide-bas.github.configure` - Configure GitHub repository
- `ai-ide-bas.github.analyze` - Analyze GitHub repository
- `ai-ide-bas.github.insights` - Show GitHub insights

## Automatic Daily Report

The GitHub telemetry service should automatically send daily reports when:

1. Extension is activated
2. GitHub service is properly configured
3. 5 seconds after activation (to avoid blocking startup)

The daily analysis includes:

- Repository snapshot collection
- Metrics calculation
- Anomaly detection
- Health alerts
- Telemetry event sending to PostHog
