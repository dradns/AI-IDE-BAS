🌍 4-Language Support: Think and Create in Your Native Language
AI IDE BAS now operates natively in Russian, English, Spanish, and Chinese not just translating, but thinking in your chosen language.
🔹 Fully localized interface: Work comfortably in your preferred language with zero friction.
🔹 Culturally adapted prompts: The LLM accounts for linguistic context, cultural nuances, and phrasing conventions unique to each language.
🔹 Native artifact generation: Outputs are created from the ground up in your selected language no post-generation translation. Logic, structure, and tone align authentically with the target linguistic context.
🎯 Why it matters: Empower every developer, analyst, and designer to collaborate with AI naturally eliminating language barriers and preserving semantic precision.
