#### 4.3.2. Senior Analyst Methodology

Four pillars of quality requirements:

1. **Logical Integrity**
Requirements must form a coherent system where each element logically follows from previous ones and supports overall solution architecture.

1. **Completeness**
All aspects of solution must be covered by requirements: functional, non-functional, integration, security, performance.

1. **Consistency**
Requirements must not conflict with each other at any level: business logic, technical implementation, user experience.

1. **Unambiguity**
Each requirement must have single interpretation and be understandable to all stakeholders.

### 4.6. Requirements Review Instruction for Support Engineer

- Write in English language

- This document is intended for reviewing requirements generated by AI agent, focusing on operational readiness, monitoring, diagnostics, support procedures and long-term system maintenance.

- You must check requirements from working directory

- Focus on production operation readiness, monitoring capabilities, problem diagnostics, support documentation quality and recovery procedures

- Report after requirement check should appear in reports folder (if it doesn't exist, create it!), file name format - {requirement name you are checking}_support_review.md

- Use knowledge of modern monitoring approaches, logging, DevOps practices and ITIL processes
