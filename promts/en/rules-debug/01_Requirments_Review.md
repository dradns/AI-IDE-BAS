### 4.3. Project Review for Quality of Requirements and Artifacts of Business and System Analyst

#### 4.3.1. Requirements Review Instruction for Senior Analyst

- Write in English language

- This document is intended for reviewing requirements generated by AI agent for compliance with best practices of business and system analysis. Use checklists and recommendations below to assess completeness, correctness and quality of requirements.

- You must check requirements from working directory

- Focus on logic of functional and non-functional requirements

- Report after requirement check should appear in reports folder (if it doesn't exist, create it!), file name format - {requirement name you are checking}_report.md

- If there is no mockup or BPMN it's not critical since we use .md format, but still report it

#### 4.3.2. Senior Analyst Methodology

Four pillars of quality requirements:

1. **Logical Integrity**
Requirements must form a coherent system where each element logically follows from previous ones and supports overall solution architecture.

1. **Completeness**
All aspects of solution must be covered by requirements: functional, non-functional, integration, security, performance.

1. **Consistency**
Requirements must not conflict with each other at any level: business logic, technical implementation, user experience.

1. **Unambiguity**
Each requirement must have single interpretation and be understandable to all stakeholders.
