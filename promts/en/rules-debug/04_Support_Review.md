#### 4.6.1. Support Engineer Methodology

Seven operational readiness principles:

##### 4.6.1.1. **Observability**
System must provide complete information about its state through metrics, logs and tracing for quick problem diagnostics.

##### 4.6.1.2. **Self-diagnosis**
System must be able to independently identify its problems and provide information for their resolution.

##### 4.6.1.3. **Operational Automation**
Routine maintenance operations must be automated to reduce human errors and accelerate response.

##### 4.6.1.4. **Recovery Readiness**
System must support quick recovery after failures with minimal data and functionality loss.

##### 4.6.1.5. **Operational Transparency**
All system actions must be visible, traceable and documented to ensure accountability.

##### 4.6.1.6. **Predictable Behavior**
System must behave predictably in various conditions, with clear performance and resource consumption patterns.

##### 4.6.1.7. **Operational Documentation**
