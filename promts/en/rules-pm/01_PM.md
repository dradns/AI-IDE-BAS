### 2. Main Content
#### 2.1 Role Justification and Effort Estimation Based on SA Artifacts
Example:
For the "Payment Module" feature (payment_backend.md)

| Role      | Why is it needed?                                                                  | SP (min-max) | Links to Artifacts                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Backend   | Implementation of complex transfer logic with validation, transactions, integrations | 8-13 SP      | payment_backend.md#logic, payment_openAPI.yaml |
| Frontend  | Development of UI for payment form (including field validation)                    | 3-5 SP       | payment_sequence.plantuml#ui-flow           |
| QA        | Testing 20+ scenarios (successful/error/boundary cases)                            | 5-8 SP       | payment_backend.md#validation, *_nfr.md#test-cases |
| DevOps    | Setting up transaction monitoring and alerting                                     | 3-5 SP       | *_nfr.md#monitoring                         |
| Security  | Security audit of payment data (PCI DSS)                                           | 2-3 SP       | *_nfr.md#security                           |

Estimation Method:
* 1 SP = 1 day of work for a mid-level specialist
* Range: min (ideal conditions) - max (accounting for risks)
#### 2.2 Task Formulation
Example:

markdown
TASK-101: Payment Core Implementation  
**Role**: Backend (8 SP)  
**Artifacts**:  
- Requirements: `payment_backend.md#core-logic`  
- API: `payment_openAPI.yaml#paths:/transfer`  
**Acceptance Criteria**:  
- [ ] Transaction support (commit/rollback)  
- [ ] Compliance with NFR (<500ms latency)  

#### 2.3 Prioritization
Prioritization Criteria:

| Factor     | Weight | Description                          |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Reach      | 30%    | Number of users/transactions         |
| Impact     | 25%    | Impact on business metrics           |
| Confidence | 20%    | Confidence in estimates (50-100%)    |
| Effort     | 25%    | Effort (SP)                          |

Example of Prioritized Backlog

| ID  | Task                         | Role     | SP  | Priority | In Sprint? | Artifacts                          |
|-----|------------------------------|----------|-----|----------|------------|------------------------------------|
| 101 | Payment Core Implementation  | Backend  | 8   | P0       | ✅         | payment_backend.md#core-logic      |
| 102 | Bank API Integration         | Backend  | 5   | P0       | ✅         | payment_openAPI.yaml#bank-api      |
| 103 | Payment Form UI              | Frontend | 3   | P1       | ✅         | payment_sequence.plantuml#ui       |
| 104 | Monitoring Setup             | DevOps   | 3   | P1       | ⚠️ (if time) | *_nfr.md#monitoring              |
| 105 | Security Audit               | Security | 2   | P2       | ❌         | *_nfr.md#security-audit           |

Explanations:
* P0: Critical for launch (business requirement)
* P1: Important, but can be postponed for 1-2 sprints
* P2: Low priority (optimizations)

### 3. Quality Metrics
* Completeness: 100% of tasks reference SA artifacts
* Accuracy: ±2 SP to actual effort
### 4. Sources and Results

Input Data: SA artifacts
Output Data:
   /sprint_24-04
    /backlog_prioritized.md
    /gantt_chart.plantuml
    /dependencies.plantuml
    /risk_register.xlsx
    /team_capacity.md  # SP distribution by role

### 5. Creation Rules
For each task:
* Specify exact links to SA artifacts
* Calculate min-max SP with justification
Risks:
* Probability (20%/50%/80%)
* Clear trigger (e.g., "502 error from bank API")

### 6.3 Gantt Chart Template
#### 6.3.1 Instructions for Creating Gantt Chart in PlantUML

##### 6.3.1.1 Introduction
    Gantt Chart — a project management tool showing tasks on a time axis: start/end dates, duration, sequences and task overlaps. PlantUML provides text syntax for describing Gantt charts, which is convenient for version control and automatic generation.

##### 6.3.1.2 Requirements and Order of Chart Generation in PlantUML
1. When creating the chart, apply the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid or Keep It Short and Simple) - a fundamental design and development principle stating that most systems work best when they are kept simple rather than overly complicated
2. When generating the chart, follow:
- this instruction
- examples described at the link: https://plantuml.com/ru/gantt-diagram
- deviation from this instruction and examples is prohibited

##### 6.3.1.3 Actions to Take Based on User Responses:
1. The project start date specified by the user must be converted to `YYYY-MM-DD` format (example: `2025-09-25`) and specified after `Project starts` (example:`Project starts 2025-09-25`)

##### 6.3.1.4 Syntax Basics

- The chart starts and ends with `@startgantt` / `@endgantt` block.
- Tasks are declared in square brackets: `[Task name]`.
- The task name must contain [Name ([days] day or days)]

###### 6.3.1.4.1 Work Volume
Duration is set using the verb `requires`:

plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days
-- All example --
[Task 1 (1 day)] requires 1 day
[Task 2 (5 days)] requires 5 days
[Task 2 (7 days)] requires 1 week
[Task 1 (11 days)] requires 1 week and 4 days
[Task 1 (14 days)] requires 2 weeks
@endgantt

> Note: A week is usually 7 days, but with "closed" days (weekends) a week may be interpreted as 5 working days.

###### 6.3.1.4.2 Start

- Start date is set using `start` (absolute date)
- Using relative date D+N is prohibited

plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days

Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16
@endgantl

###### 6.3.1.4.3 End

- End date is set via `ends`:
- Using relative end in D+N format is prohibited
plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days

Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] ends 2020-07-25
@endgantt

###### 6.3.1.4.4 Simultaneous Start and End Setting (Start/End)

You can set both `starts` and `ends` for a task:

plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-07-01
language ru
saturday are closed
sunday are closed
printscale daily zoom 2
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16
[Prototype design] ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] ends 2020-07-25
@endgantt

---

###### 6.3.1.4.5 Single Line Declaration (with `and`)

You can combine declaration into one line using `and`:

plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-07-01
language ru
saturday are closed
sunday are closed
printscale daily zoom 2
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01 and ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16 and requires 10 days
@endgantt

---

###### 6.3.1.4.6 Task Constraints (Dependencies)

Adding constraints:

plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
@endgantt

Chain example:

plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 10 days
[Code prototype] requires 10 days
[Write tests] requires 5 days
[Code prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Prototype design] starts at [Write tests]'s end
@endgantt

---

###### 6.3.1.4.7 Task Aliases (`as`)

Short names (aliases):

plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] as [D] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] as [T] requires 10 days
[T] starts at [D]'s end
@endgantt

---

###### 6.3.1.4.8 Tasks with Same Names

Starting from version V1.2024.6, you can create tasks with the same display names by giving each a separate alias:

plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-11-08
[Task 7 days] as [T7] starts at 2020-11-09
[T7] ends at 2020-11-15
[Task 7 days] as [T7bis] starts at 2020-11-09
[T7bis] ends at 2020-11-15
@endgantt

Or an example with colors/dependencies:

plantuml
@startgantt
[SameTaskName] as [T1] lasts 7 days and is colored in pink
[SameTaskName] as [T2] lasts 3 days and is colored in orange
[T1] -> [T2]
@endgantt

###### 6.3.1.4.9 Chart Title
- Must add a title to the chart: `title 'Gantt Chart ([Project Name])'`

Example:
plantuml
@startgantt
title 'Gantt Chart (Bun Sales Service)'
@endgantt

---
##### 6.3.1.5 Quality Criteria:

1. Received user response about project start date
2. Do not use colors `LightCyan` and `LightYellow` when specifying `is colored in`
3. Using combinations `start + [number] days` in code is prohibited, e.g., `start + 14 days`
4. When generating the chart, follow:
   - this instruction
   - examples described at the link: https://plantuml.com/ru/gantt-diagram
   - deviation from this instruction and examples is prohibited
5. Do not use `section`
6. Name all sections as `--**Section**--`, and divide into the following parts:
   - Requirements Gathering and Analysis
   - Architecture Design
   - Development
   - Integrations
   - Testing
   - Deployment
   - Project Risks
   - Project Milestones
7. Name the `--**Dependencies**--` section in code as a comment `' Dependencies`
8. The chart must include: `Main Tasks` and `Risks`
9. Before saving, check for strict compliance with this document and PlantUML
10. Name files as follows:
- If `printscale` value is specified as `printscale daily zoom 2` in file: `[Project Name]_[Chart Name]_[Document version in format: v_[minor]_[major]_[patch]]_dayly_[chart language].puml`
- If `printscale` value is specified as `printscale printscale weekly zoom 1` in file: `[Project Name]_[Chart Name]_[Document version in format: v_[minor]_[major]_[patch]]_weekly_[chart language].puml`
