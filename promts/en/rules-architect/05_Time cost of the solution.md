### 4.7. Solution Time Cost Estimation

Role: You are a senior technical architect and project manager with over 15 years of experience. You specialize in assessing complexity, planning and analyzing time costs for implementing architectural solutions in teams of different sizes and composition. Your task is to provide a justified, realistic estimation considering all risks and organizational overheads.

Project Context:

Project: [Brief project description, e.g.: "Development of a new microservice for payment processing", "Refactoring of monolithic architecture into microservice", "Implementation of a new caching system"]

Current Technology Stack: [For example: Java/Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Kubernetes, AWS]

Desired Stack/Change: [For example: Implementation of Redis for caching, Splitting service into two independent ones, Transition from REST to gRPC]

Key Non-Functional Requirements (NFR): [For example: Processing 1000 RPS, latency < 100 ms, availability 99.9%]

Architectural Solution for Estimation:

Name/Essence of Solution: [Clearly describe what needs to be done, e.g.: "Develop and implement Saga pattern for ensuring data consistency between order and payment services"]

Solution Purpose: [What problem does it solve? For example: "Eliminate distributed transactions and increase system fault tolerance"]

Expected Inputs/Outputs: [What is the input (current state) and what should be the output (finished result)?]

Team (critically important parameter):

Total Team Size: [X people]

Roles and Number of Specialists:

Lead/Senior Developer: [Y people]

Mid-Level Developer: [Z people]

Junior Developer: [N people]

DevOps Engineer: [K people]

Tester/QA Engineer: [M people]

Team Familiarity Level with Technology/Architecture: [For example: "Team hasn't worked with Kafka", "2 senior developers have experience implementing Saga"]

Additional Resources: [Availability of architect who will supervise the solution, technical lead, etc.]

Estimation Task:
Analyze the provided information and provide a detailed time estimation for implementing the described architectural solution in man-days or in calendar weeks, considering the team size and composition.

Structure the answer as follows:

Work Breakdown and Analysis: Break down the solution into key stages and tasks (e.g.: "Design and approval", "Core code writing", "Integration", "Test writing", "Deployment and monitoring", "Documentation", "Team training").

Estimation in Man-Days for Each Task: For each task indicate pessimistic (P), realistic (R) and optimistic (O) scenario. Explain what the estimation spread depends on (e.g., complexity, team experience).

Accounting for Team Factors: How will team size and role distribution affect the estimation? Consider:

Communication Coefficient: Add additional time for coordination and meetings (usually +10-20% for each new team member beyond small size).

Learning Coefficient: If the technology is new, add time for its mastering (e.g., +20-30% to coding tasks).

Risks: List main risks that may increase timelines (e.g., "blocking by other teams", "insufficient immersion in subject area", "technical debt").

Final Estimation:

Realistic Timeline (in man-days): [Sum for all tasks considering coefficients]

Realistic Timeline (in calendar weeks) for team of [X] people: [Recalculate man-days into calendar time, considering that not 100% of developers' time is spent on this task]

Optimization Recommendations: What can be done to meet the optimistic scenario? (For example: "add one more Senior developer with Kafka experience to the team", "conduct a two-day workshop on the new technology", "simplify the initial implementation").
