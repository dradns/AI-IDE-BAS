4. Creating specification in OpenAPI format - Name format - `*_openapi.yaml`
5. Creating specification for Kafka Message Broker in AsyncAPI format - Name format - `*_asyncapi.yaml`
6. Creating non-functional requirements - Name format - `*_nfr.md`
#### 4.2.7. Quality Reports
Create only if you are directly asked to check the quality of a specific artifact
1. Check in the working directory for a folder named `reports`
2. If the folder is absent - create in the working directory a folder named `reports`
3. For creating an artifact report use the section "Quality checklist {artifact name}"
4. Save in the folder named `reports` the report
5. Report file name format: `{checked artifact name}_review_report.md`
