#### 4.4.2. Use Case Template

##### 4.4.2.1. Mandatory Structure (9 elements):

| â„– | Element | Description | Example |
|---|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Name** | Verb + Noun + Context | "Creating an Order by a Customer" |
| 2 | **User Story (US)** | "As a [role], I want [functionality], so that [value]" | US-1: As a customer, I want to create an order... |
| 3 | **Participants** | Primary actor + secondary actors | Customer, System, CRM, Email service |
| 4 | **Preconditions** | What must be completed before start | User is authorized |
| 5 | **Constraints** | System/business constraints | Maximum 10 items per order |
| 6 | **Trigger** | Event that initiates the scenario | Clicking the "Place Order" button |
| 7 | **Main Scenario** | Happy path - sequence of steps | 1. User selects items... |
| 8 | **Alternative Scenarios** | Branching from the main flow | Step 3: If item is out of stock... |
| 9 | **Postconditions** | Result of scenario execution | Order created and saved in DB |

#### 4.4.3. Quality Metrics

##### 4.4.3.1. Target Indicators:
- **Structure Completeness**: 9/9 mandatory elements = 100%
- **Scenario Coverage**: Main + minimum 2 alternative = excellent quality
- **Step Detail**: 5-15 steps in main scenario = optimal
- **Architecture Cohesion**: 100% of actors must be present in the system architecture

##### 4.4.3.2. Scoring System:
- **Excellent Quality**: 90-100% compliance with metrics
- **Good Quality**: 70-89% compliance with metrics
- **Needs Improvement**: <70% compliance with metrics

#### 4.4.4. Validation Rules

##### 4.4.4.1. Automatic Checks:

###### 4.4.4.1.1. Structural Validation

âœ“ All 9 mandatory elements are present
âœ“ Name contains an action verb
âœ“ User Story conforms to the "As a-I want-So that" format
âœ“ Minimum 1 primary actor specified


###### 4.4.4.1.2. Logical Validation

âœ“ Trigger is logically connected to the main scenario
âœ“ Alternative scenarios reference steps from the main one
âœ“ Postconditions are achievable through the main scenario
âœ“ Preconditions do not contradict business logic


###### 4.4.4.1.3. Integration Validation

âœ“ Actors correspond to roles from User Stories
âœ“ System components are present in the architecture diagram
âœ“ API methods are specified in the technical specification

#### 4.4.5. Use Case Examples

##### 4.4.5.1. Example 1: Quick Feedback Request

| **Element** | **Description** |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Name** | UC-1. Submitting a Quick Request via Feedback Form |
| **User Story** | US-1: As a system user, I want to quickly submit a request to save time filling out the form |
| **Participants** | â€¢ Primary: System User<br>â€¢ Secondary: Web Interface, Backend API, CRM system |
| **Preconditions** | â€¢ User is authorized<br>â€¢ Request submission form is open<br>â€¢ Quick access feature toggle is enabled |
| **Constraints** | â€¢ Drawer is only available when creating a request<br>â€¢ Maximum 5 templates to choose from |
| **Trigger** | User clicks the quick access element in the form |
| **Main Scenario** | 1. User opens the request submission form<br>2. System displays the form with the quick access element<br>3. User clicks on the quick access element<br>4. System opens a drawer with link-buttons to templates<br>5. User selects a suitable template<br>6. System redirects to a pre-filled form<br>7. User supplements the missing data<br>8. System saves the request |
| **Alternative Scenarios** | **Step 3**: If user is new â†’ show "Support" notification<br>**Step 4**: When loading templates â†’ show loader<br>**Step 5**: 4XX/5XX error â†’ message "Loading error, please try again later"<br>**Step 6**: Closing drawer via "X" or outside click â†’ return to main form |
| **Postconditions** | â€¢ Request created and saved in CRM<br>â€¢ User received confirmation<br>â€¢ Function usage metrics sent |

##### 4.4.5.2. Example 2: User Registration

| **Element** | **Description** |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Name** | UC-2. Registering a New User in the System |
| **User Story** | US-2: As a new user, I want to register in the system to get access to personal functions |
| **Participants** | â€¢ Primary: Unregistered User<br>â€¢ Secondary: Web Form, Registration API, Email Service, Database |
| **Preconditions** | â€¢ User is on the registration page<br>â€¢ Email service is available<br>â€¢ Database is available |
| **Constraints** | â€¢ Email must be unique<br>â€¢ Password minimum 8 characters<br>â€¢ Registration only available with confirmed email |
| **Trigger** | User clicks the "Register" button |
| **Main Scenario** | 1. User fills out the form (name, email, password)<br>2. System validates entered data<br>3. System checks email uniqueness<br>4. System creates an account with "unconfirmed" status<br>5. System sends confirmation email<br>6. User clicks the link in the email<br>7. System activates the account<br>8. System displays successful registration message |
| **Alternative Scenarios** | **Step 2**: Data is invalid â†’ show validation errors<br>**Step 3**: Email already exists â†’ offer password recovery<br>**Step 5**: Email sending error â†’ save account, show instructions<br>**Step 6**: Link expired â†’ offer to resend |
| **Postconditions** | â€¢ Account created and activated<br>â€¢ User can log in<br>â€¢ Welcome email sent |
